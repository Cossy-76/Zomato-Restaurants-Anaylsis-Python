<p>Zomato Restaurants in Bengaluru - Data Analysis Project</p>
<p>Project Overview</p>
<p>This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis of Zomato restaurant data in Bengaluru, India. The project spans multiple exercises (Exercise 6.1 to Exercise 6.5) and covers data cleaning, relationship exploration, geographical visualizations, machine learning analyses, and time series analysis.</p>
<p>Key Exercises</p>
<p>Exercise 6.1: Zomato Data Cleaning:</p>
<p>Ensured data accuracy and completeness by addressing missing or inconsistent values in the Zomato dataset.</p>
<p>Exercise 6.2: Exploring Relationships:</p>
<p>Created correlation matrix heatmap for Cost for two people, ratings, and votes.
Generated scatterplots and pair plots to visualize relationships.
Plotted distribution frequencies and categorized costs for deeper insights.</p>
<p>Exercise 6.3: Geographical Visualizations:</p>
<p>Utilized Folium and other libraries for visualizing restaurant locations, cluster analysis, average ratings, and restaurant types.</p>
<p>Exercise 6.4: Machine Learning (Regression Analysis):</p>
<p>Conducted regression analysis on Cost for two people and votes, assessing model performance and handling outliers.</p>
<p>Exercise 6.5: Machine Learning (Clustering Algorithm):</p>
<p>Utilized the &quot;elbow technique&quot; to determine optimal clusters, creating scatterplots to identify patterns.</p>
<p>Exercise 6.6: Unemployment Time Series Analysis:</p>
<p>Imported Quandl library, analyzed U.S. unemployment data, and conducted time series analysis.</p>
